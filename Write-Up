paragraph 1: game description; what is this game about? why did you choose this topic?

This game is about one day during summer when i was sitting at a beach in my home country. I was reminiscing about my time in high school and all the good memories i had.
I felt like i wanted to choose this topic because it got me thinking about how much my life has changed since starting college and how that had changed who i am as a person.
However, i also found myself thinking about all the lessons and things i learned about life as a human during those times. The triumphs and the failures.


paragraph 2: your process; what was the initial idea and how did it evolve as you worked? 
My process started out with a game that was just meant to be a main hub that went into 6 different flat games that represent a memory that i had. However, i found that it 
made it more interesting to incorporate an actual beach. When i was sitting in the beach recalling these memories, i distinctly remember being distracted and taken out of it
by the sound of waves and birds. so i decided to integrate them into a failure mechanic that if you get "distracted" by touching these birds or waves, then you would be 
taken back to the beach and you have to work to recall the memories again from scratch. 

paragraph 3: one specific development challenge and how you solved it (or why it was unsolvable)
One developmental challenge was finding a way to integrate sounds into the failure mechanic. I wanted to hear the wave if you got touched by the wave or hear the bird
if you touched the bird text. However, since i was doing a load scene method or reseting, i couldn't figure out how to make this work in time.
